# Code Sponsor Advertising Prospectus

### Overview

Software developers regularly visit websites such as github.com, npmjs.com and readthedocs.io on a daily basis to find and read documentation on open source software. According to the [Github Octoverse 2016 report](https://octoverse.github.com/), there are 5.8M+ developers with 19.4M+ active open source repositories on Github alone.

Typically, advertisers would use channels such as Google Adwords, Facebook, etc. to reach their customers. Even though this can be effective, Code Sponsor provides direct access to developers via new channels:

* Github
* Gitlab
* Bitbucket
* NPMJS.com
* ReadTheDocs.io [(over 26M+ monthly pageviews)](https://www.seethestats.com/site/readthedocs.org)
* More

Code Sponsor provides a very simple platform which allows you to create your ad in one place, then have it display across all channels.

If software engineers are a target customer for your business, we are the best way for you to get your message out.

### Pricing

Pricing is negotiable. We want to make sure that whatever you spend, you will see a positive ROI.

### Targeting Details

We offer the ability to target based on:

* Programming language
* Geographic segmentation (depends on channel)
* Repository activity (popular vs obscure/long tail)

We do not provide third party tracking or remote scripting support.

### Language Segmentation

Every repository that holds your advertisement relates to a specific piece of software. This allows us to target each pageview to the programming language that the project is written in.

This is useful when product being advertised targets/supports specific languages.

### Geographic Segmentation

We support geo-targeting across certain channels. This allows you to target your messages to specific countries of interest, or exclude a set of countries that aren't relevant to your ads.

### Reported Statistics

We track common statistics on our platform and will report them to you at the end of your ad placement.

We track the following:

* Impressions (total + unique)
* Clicks

### Limitations

One of the major concerns software developers have with the current advertising industry is the tracking of users with third-party scripts. To address this, *we do not allow any third-party scripts to be run in our ad placements.*

### Placement

We do our best to provide the highest quality, non-obtrusive ads that developers will want to click on. We will work with you to generate messaging that developers will appreciate and understand. The ad will be placed across a multitude of open source projects that developers look at every day.

Here's an example of a doc page with an advertisiment:

The specifics of the ad placement are:

* Ads must be text-based. They can contain a title and blurb.
* Ads must be relevant to the developer community
* The ad must be a maximum of 85 characters (title + blurb)

### Examples

Here are a some examples of what developers want to see:

<img src="https://github.com/codesponsor/sponsor/blob/master/assets/cs-example-ad-1.png?raw=true" style="width: 800px; 
height: 80px;" width="800" height="80" />

<img src="https://github.com/codesponsor/sponsor/blob/master/assets/cs-example-ad-2.png?raw=true" style="width: 800px; height: 80px;" width="800" height="80" />

### Placement (ReadTheDocs.io)

Code Sponsor has partnered with ReadTheDocs.io to extend the marketing reach. **ReadTheDocs alone has over 26 million page views each month.** Because ReadTheDocs is a developer documentation platform and not a code repository, they have found image-based advertisements to be more effective and acceptable to the developers.

We only display one high-quality ad per page, and only for products and services that we believe our users will love. We work the ad display and copy to fit with the general theme of our hosted documentation pages. The ad placement appears on the documentation navigation menu and doesn't impact the users usage of the documentation pages. It will be found on hosted documentation pages under the last navigation menu item and will not scroll off the top of the page as readers scroll down the page.

Here's an example of a doc page with an advertisiment:

![An example of a doc page with an advertisement](https://github.com/codesponsor/sponsor/blob/master/assets/rtd-example.png?raw=true)

The specifics of the ad placement are:

* Ad images are displayed at 120x90px, however image resolution should be 240x180px. This resolution will be reduced to our display size of 120x90px, but the higher resolution allows for sharp display on high-DPI devices, such as Apple's Retina displays
* Images should be in PNG format, not a lossy format such as JPG
* The graphic should not have a border
* The ad will include supporting text. Images should avoid unnecessary copy due to the small image resolution
* Ads should favor supporting text over including copy in the ad image.
* Supporting text should be 80 characters or less
* Supporting text can be linked in its entirety, or words can be linked selectively
* The image will be linked to the same page as supporting text

### Examples (ReadTheDocs.io)

Here are a couple examples of things that have worked well in the past. They fit into the site, and converted well for the companies:

<img src="https://github.com/codesponsor/sponsor/blob/master/assets/rtd-example-ad-1.png?raw=true" style="width: 347px; 
height: 212px;" width="347" height="212" />

<img src="https://github.com/codesponsor/sponsor/blob/master/assets/rtd-example-ad-2.png?raw=true" style="width: 347px; height: 216px;" width="347" height="216" />
