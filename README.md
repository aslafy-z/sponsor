## Overview

Software developers regularly visit websites such as github.com, npmjs.com and readthedocs.io on a daily basis to find and read documentation on open source software. According to the [Github Octoverse 2016 report](https://octoverse.github.com/), **there are 5.8M+ developers with 19.4M+ active open source repositories on Github alone.**

Typically, advertisers would use channels such as Google Adwords, Facebook, etc. to reach their customers. Even though this can be effective, Code Sponsor provides direct access to developers via new channels:

* Github
* Gitlab
* Bitbucket
* NPMJS.com
* More

Code Sponsor provides a very simple platform which allows you to create your ad in one place, then have it display across all channels.

If software engineers are a target customer for your business, we are the best way for you to get your message out.

## Pricing

Pricing is negotiable. We want to make sure that whatever you spend, you will see a positive ROI.

## Targeting Details

We offer the ability to target based on:

* Programming language
* Geographic segmentation (depends on channel)
* Repository activity (popular vs obscure/long tail)

We do not provide third party tracking or remote scripting support.

## Language Segmentation

Every repository that holds your advertisement relates to a specific piece of software. This allows us to target each pageview to the programming language that the project is written in.

This is useful when product being advertised targets/supports specific languages.

## Geographic Segmentation

We support geo-targeting across certain channels. This allows you to target your messages to specific countries of interest, or exclude a set of countries that aren't relevant to your ads.

## Reported Statistics

We track common statistics on our platform and will report them to you at the end of your ad placement.

We track the following:

* Impressions (total + unique)
* Clicks

## Limitations

One of the major concerns software developers have with the current advertising industry is the tracking of users with third-party scripts. To address this, *we do not allow any third-party scripts to be run in our ad placements.*

## Placement

We do our best to provide the highest quality, non-obtrusive ads that developers will want to click on. We will work with you to generate messaging that developers will appreciate and understand. The ad will be placed across a multitude of open source projects that developers look at every day.

Here's an example of a doc page with an advertisiment:

![An example of a github README with an advertisement](https://github.com/codesponsor/sponsor/blob/master/assets/cs-example.png?raw=true)

The specifics of the ad placement are:

* Ads must be text-based. They can contain a title and blurb.
* Ads must be relevant to the developer community
* The ad must be a maximum of 85 characters (title + blurb)

## Examples

Here are a some examples of what developers want to see:
